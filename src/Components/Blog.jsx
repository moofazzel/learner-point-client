                Cross-origin resource sharing (CROS) is a mechanism that allows
                restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another
                domain outside the domain from which the first resource was
                served. A web page may freely embed cross-origin images,
                stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos.

                Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use
                SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your
                app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers,
                popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and
                Twitter, and more. The best Firebase alternatives are: Auth0,
                MongoDB. MongoDB,Passport, Okta, JSON Web Token, Keycloak,
                Amazon Cognito.

                How does the private route work? The private route component is
                similar to the public route, the only change is that redirect
                URL and authenticate condition. If the user is not authenticated
                he will be redirected to the login page and the user can only
                access the authenticated routes If he is authenticated (Logged
                in).
